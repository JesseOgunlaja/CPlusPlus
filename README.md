This is a collection of all my C++ projects.

When analysing code keep in mind I do very very beginner C++.

I only really do it as a hobby from time to time.

You'll find in a lot of them me using the `and` operator and the `not` operator. Instead of `&&` and `!`.

I know this is incorrect and I've changed it in some of them.
